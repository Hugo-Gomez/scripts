# Scripts to make life easier

Scripts used for personnal use, feel free to use some that are usefull for you.
And yeah, those scripts aren't very elaborate, but I don't care, they just works.

I recommend to clone in your $HOME directory
```
git clone https://github.com/Hugo-Gomez/scripts .scripts
```

Give you rights to execute every files
```
chmod u+x .scripts/*
```

Add scripts in your PATH (put it in your shell rc file to make it permanent)
```
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.scripts
```
